Asm
I'm not quite experience in creating shellcode. I did to some assembly when I was into reverse engineering games so I do know a
bit of Assembly in x86 Intel but, it was a long time and now we have x64 bit machines.
So I didn't know what to do and I promised myself not to look at Adam's solution, so I started googling for way to do all this 
by mostly hand because I wanted it to be a learning experiment. I knew there's an easier way to generate shell code with tools,
but I didn't want to take that route.
I found an Article with a simple hello world example of how to create shellcode by using syscall and NASM. I copied and compiled 
it and did an object dump on the execute file, but the problem is, the offset of the string would not be the same when I put
the shell code into the program. The string offset would actually be the length of the shellcode because it would be at the end
of shellcode. So I calculated the offset, compiled it, and ran the script to convert to hex and did a printf + hex result into a file
. I then did another printf "hello" and append it to the file. I think ran asm execute with the file that has my shellcode and it 
worked. Now, all I had to do now is open the file, read the file and then print out the content of the file which is the flag.
This was a bit hard but not really because I had to first leave some space at the end of my shellcode for the long filename and 
also leave some space for the content that will be read into a file. I manage to do this but on my machine. Now, all I have to
do is write a program that will ssh into server, send a packet that will call nc and another packet with my shellcode and it 
should print out the flag. At first, I thought I need to leave space for both the filename and the read buffer but I could 
actually use the name space for the read buffer since, it wouldn't be need it anymore after I opened the file.
